This program runs a pastel colored calculator. It was my first time making a calculator, so I just included basic functions.
For it to work, the buttons must be pressed to enter your input (the buttons will turn yellow once clicked). 
The calculator can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and clear the screen.
