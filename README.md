This program (called colorful_calculator) runs a pastel colored calculator. It was my first time making a calculator, so I just included basic functions. To enter the input, the user should click on the buttons, not type. The calculator can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and clear the screen. I made this project because I wanted to create something beginner-friendly to expand by Python skills! I saw it commonly listed as a core beginner project, so I thought itâ€™d be a good project to tackle. I made this calculator primarily using what I was learning from YouTube videos, websites, and other online resources. I customized what I was learning to make the calculator my own! I struggled a little bit with the functionality of the buttons, along with small formatting and style errors, but I got to a point where I was satisfied after researching my questions.
